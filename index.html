        <p>Jerry Seinfeld: Ow!

(The music resumes and birds are heard tweeting)

Buzz buzz buzz, buzz buzz buzz. I know what I'll do. I'll harvest these flowers.

[ROOSTER CROW]

Buzz buzz buzz, buzz buzz buzz.

[COW MOOING]

Hey, wait a minute. (Bumps into the wall) Ow!

(We see two men pulling levers. They experience technical difficulties.)

Buzz buzz buzz, buzz buzz... (Hits the wall again) Ow! Buzz, buzz, buzz...

(We cut to the two men having more and more trouble with the levers)

Where's Steven? (Hits the wall again) Oh!

(We cut to Steven Spielberg taking a selfie with a woman, before selfies were even a thing.)

Jerry Seinfeld (Off-screen): WHERE'S STEVEN!?

Steven Spielberg: Okay. (Takes the picture)

Jerry Seinfeld (On-screen): SOMEBODY HELP ME!

Steven Spielberg: Excuse me.

Woman: Yeah.

Steven Spielberg: Sorry.

(Jerry screams while dangling out of control)

Jerry Seinfeld: GET ME DOWN!

Director (Calling out): Cut, cut! Cut! (Sprains his arm) Ow!

Man with a bullhorn: Alright, cut, cut, cut.

(The two men stop fighting with the levers and release them. The sandbags behind them land onto the floor and Jerry screams while falling into the flowerpot prop, and breaking it open by accident.)

Steven Spielberg: Jerry. Problem with the scene?

Jerry Seinfeld: (Gets up while groaning in pain) Steven, this isn't good. Nothing's working. It's like 150 degrees inside this head. (A piece of Styrofoam bounces off of Steven's head, then Jerry breaks a pink board open.) All these props are garbage.

Steven Spielberg: You know what E.T. was made out of?

Jerry Seinfeld: What?

Steven Spielberg: E.T. was made out of brown play-doh and chicken wire.

Jerry Seinfeld: I did not know that, Steven. And I'm thrilled for your success.

Steven Spielberg: Thank you. (Flicks a piece of Styrofoam off the lid of his coffee cup)

Jerry Seinfeld: But, I just don't think the audience is ever really gonna believe I'm a bee.

Steven Spielberg: Alright, alright. Look, why don't you just make it into a cartoon?

Jerry Seinfeld: Alright.

(The screen pulls away in the next shot)

Man with a bullhorn: IT'S A CARTOON!

(The background for the window falls off and the studio lights turn off. After a few seconds of silence, Jerry speaks his last line.)

Jerry Seinfeld: Anybody know how to draw?

Off-screen Man: I do.

(Screen fades to black, then from black revealing the flowerpot hanging from a windowsill. Then Barry B. Benson flies down from the top of the frame.)

Barry B. Benson (While flying): Oh, I should have been doing it like this to begin with! Now I'm ready for some acting! (Cries dramatically) And flying! (The camera follows him as he flies down to the road. He flies past a few cars.) Stunts! (Two cars explode from behind him) Whoa! (Flies up to a billboard with the movie's title on it) Scary stuff!

(Vincent from "Over the Hedge" jumps from the roof as he roars and Barry lands right next to the title)

Barry B. Benson: Like to see Spielberg do that with chicken wire and play-doh. Heh.

        <p>Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,

  
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,

  
Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.

  
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

  
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?

  
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.

  
What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

  
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

  
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.

  
How old are you?

  
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,

  
which will be the trial
of the bee century.

  
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.

  
It's a common name. Next week...

  
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...

  
Next week...

  
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.

  
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.

  
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.</p>
